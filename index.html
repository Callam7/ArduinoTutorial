                                        <p>To get started, we will need to arrange which hardware parts we will be using. In the figure below, you will see the minimum items needed to complete the overall course:</p>
										<img src="images/tools.jpg" alt="tools" width="500px" height="500px" class="rotate90">
										<p>From left to right:					
											<ul>
												<li>Motor Driver</li>
												<li>Distance Sensor</li>
												<li>1-4 LEDs</li>
												<li>1-3 330Ohm Resistors</li>
												<li>1 Switch</li>
												<li>1 4 Slot Battery Pack + 4 AA Batteries</li>
												<li>20-25 Jumper Wires</li>
												<li>1 Micro USB Cable</li>
												<li>2 Wheels</li>
												<li>1 Base Board with Breadboard and Spark Fun Red Board</li>
												<li>2 Binder Clips</li>
											</ul> 
										</p>
										<p>The above items are typically available at local hardware stores, such as Jay Car or Mitre 10. However, it is easier to purchase a kit that includes all the parts needed. They are needed for the final product, not all items are needed for the exercises. </p>
                                                <br>

                                        <h3><span class = "blue">Setting Up The Sketches</span></h3>
                                        <p>Before we continue on to the next set up stage, we should get to know a couple of key terms and phrases for using the Arduino GUI software.</p>
										<br>
										<h4><span class = "blue">What</span><span class = "green"> Is</span><span class = "red"> A Library?</span></h4>
										<p>
											A library is a simple file coded in either C or C++ programming language, of which contains some extra functionality needed to run certain strings of code. They typically signal the Arduino environment to link and compile that library’s code with your sketch.
										</p>
										<br>
										<h4><span class = "blue">What</span><span class = "green"> Is</span><span class = "red"> A Shield?</span></h4>
										<img src="images/shield.jpg" alt="shield" width="300px" height="300px">
                                        <p>
										The shield is a piece of hardware that you can mount on the Arduino to give it a specific purpose (i.e. such as the motor driver we will be using later on). Think of it as the physical version of the library.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <h4><span class = "green">What</span> <span class = "blue"> Are Sketches?</span></h4>
                                        <p>
										They are the name specifically used to name the program the Arduino uses. It is the base code that is uploaded to an Arduino board.
										</p>
										<br>
										<h4><span class = "green">What</span> <span class = "blue"> Is A "330 ohms" Resistor?</span></h4>
										<img src="images/330ohm.jpg" alt="resistor" width="300px" height="300px">
                                        <p>
										The 330ohms resistor is basically used as a “get you going” value that works on an average enough rate to power LEDS or other device tools. The purpose of this is to drop any voltage that is not required to power the LED when it is working at a satisfactory current. 
										</p>
										<br>
										<h4><span class = "green">What</span> <span class = "blue"> Is An Ohm?</span></h4>
                                        <p>
										This is the unit of electrical resistance, of which transmits a current of one ampere when subjected to a potential difference of one volt. This measurement is typically used for calculating which devices require a certain amount of power to operate. For more information, see <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/dccircuits/dcp_2.html">Ohms Law and Power.</a>
                                        </p>
										<br>
                                        <p>
										For the next stage of the set up requirements, follow along with the steps in order to install the required software:
										</p>
										<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3><span class = "red">Software Set Up</span></h3></button>
										<div class="collapse">
										<p><em>Step 1: Download The Installer<br>
											Navigate to the <a href = "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">download page</a> and download the latest version of Arduino IDE.</em>
										</p>
										<br>
										<p><em>Step 2: Running The Installation<br>
											Once that has downloaded, run the installer and you will come across a warning. This simply means that you need to confirm that this program is allowed to be on your device, and is allowed to install the necessary drivers.
											After the warning, the installation process will take you here:
											<br>
											<img src="images/install1.png" alt="insta1" width="400px" height="300px">
											<br>
											Select all components that you wish to have installed (for the task we will be doing, you'll need all of them). </em>
										</p>
										<br>
										<p><em>Step 3: Directory<br>
											Next select where you would like to store the Arduino program files:</em>
											<br>
											<img src="images/install2.png" alt="insta2" width="400px" height="300px">
										</p>
										<br>
										<p><em>Step 4: Library Download<br>
											Now that we have installed the Arduino IDE program, we now need to download the library we will be using. Navigate to the following <a href = "https://www.sparkfun.com/sikcode">link</a> and select <b>SIK V4.1 CODE</b>.
											Once downloaded, extract the folder to your Arduino folder location that you've chosen (for example, I used my Documents folder). Once done, you should be able to see <b>SIK-Guide-Code-Master</b> under <b>File->Sketchbook</b> in the IDE navigation bar.</em>

													<p><em>Step 5: Running The Program<br>
